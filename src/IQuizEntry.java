/**
 * IQuizEntry.java
 * Assignment: Final Project - Studiam
 * Purpose:Studiam would be a tool used to help memorize specific vocabulary for classes and
 * practice for tests, particularly for learning complex languages like Latin. Users would
 * be able to type up or import vocabulary lists for classes into the software and practice
 * with the material. The software would randomly generate mock-up practice tests with all
 * of the content, optionally timed, and we give immediate feedback. It would also have the
 * tools to make the test as “smart” as possible, i.e. accepting multiple potential answers,
 * common spelling mistakes, punctuation and capitalization accepted. The focus would also
 * be on user-friendliness, and much of the development would be focused on making an intuitive,
 * aesthetically pleasing user interface that could be piloted well even without much experience.
